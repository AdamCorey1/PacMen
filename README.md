# Pacmen exercise

This project is a small pacmen game that allows you to continously add pacmen images to the console and raise the movement velocity by clicking on the "start game" button. In the future I plan to add other objects to the game to make it have more options other than pacman. I most likely will add all of the ghosts to this as well.

Directions
1. Download repository or files and run index.html
2. Click "Add PacMan"
3. Click "Start game" to increase velocity
